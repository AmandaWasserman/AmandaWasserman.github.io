								<b>ML Applications for Spectroscopic Follow-up of LSST Discovered Transients</b><br>
								I am a third-year graduate student who is part of the LSST commissioning team and is working to prepare for the incoming plethora of data. 
								I am preparing a pipeline for selecting which transient events merit spectroscopic follow-up. Currently, only about 8% of transients are being followed up on due 
								to the expensive nature of taking spectroscopic data. As LSST will discover 10-100 times the number of transients while available spectroscopic time remains fixed,
								this fraction will fall to less than 0.1%. Thus, it is imperative that we have a pipeline to determine what is most important to follow-up on.
								I will be implementing the active learning pipeline: the Recommendation System for Spectroscopic Follow-up (<a href="https://resspect.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">RESSPECT</a>). 
								I am working to deploy and validate RESSPECT on public alerts 
								from the Zwicky Transient Facility, the DECam Alliance for Transients, and the Young Supernova Experiment. The resulting pipeline will be well-prepared for LSST first
								light when the algorithmâ€™s performance will be tested on Rubin commissioning data and optimized for operations. Follow-up spectroscopy of 
								LSST discovered transients not only reveals the class and redshift but is also key to understanding the physics behind explosive time-domain phenomena such as supernovae,
								kilonovae, and tidal disruption events.
								


							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Follow-up of Nearby Transients with the Young Supernova Experiment</b><br>
								Many surveys and much telescope time has been focused on obtaining a high-redshift sample of type Ia supernovae, 
								which are now more well sampled and better calibrated than the low-redshift sample. 
								The lacking low-redshift samples are responsible for uncertainties on our
								cosmological constraints largely due to systematics when calibrating data from various heterogeneous
								photometric systems. I analyze incoming transient supernova data to perform spectroscopic follow-up of young 
								and nearby supernovae using GMOS on Gemini North and South.
								With LSST coming online in 2025, this will be crucial to mitigate uncertainties 
								by improving the low-redshift sample, lest the millions of supernovae LSST will observe will have marginal 
								impact on constraining cosmological parameters. YSE will replace these outdated legacy data with a large, 
								well calibrated sample of low-z type Ia supernovae

							<p>
								<b>Outreach:</b>
								<br>
								Spooky Science Day (seen above!):
								
								<br>
								
								I organized over 10 STEM clubs at the University of Rochester to present "spooky" science demonstrations
								for Rochester families around Halloween. We had over 200 participants each year.

								<br>
								I organized events with local Rochester girl scout troups to aid them in achieving their space science badges.
								
								<br>
								I was a tour guide for the C.E.K. Mees Observatory at the University of Rochester.
								<br>

								I organize Astronomy on Tap, public outreach talks, for Urbana-Champaign community members.
								
								<br>
								
								I help organize and lead the Girls' Astronomy Summer Camp for high schoolers in the Urbana-Champaign area. This is a two
								day camp that is fully sponsored by the UIUC Department of Astronomy. Throughout their time with us, the students
								visit a planetarium, observe using the historic telescope on campus, and learn about astronomy and coding basics.
								
							</p>

							<p>
								<b>Equity & Inclusion:</b><br>
								At the University of Illinois, I was chair of the Society for Equity in Astronomy (SEA). During my tenure as chair, I organized
								a mentoring program between the graduate students and undergraduate students which supported about 30 mentor/mentee pairs.
								I held monthly Astronomy Culture Journal Clubs in which the members of the astronomy department at every level are encouraged to 
								join a discussion about a current cultural topic in astronomy and academia (eg. navigating academia with a disability and the environmental impact of astronomy). 
								We would host colloquium speakers for tea and bagels to discuss diversity, equity, and inclusion among various institutions.
								
								<br>
								<br>
								I was a research mentor for a student in the Illinois Developing Equity in Astrophysics Summer school (IDEAS).
								<br>
								<br>
								I co-founded the Society of Women in Astronomy and Physics (SWAP) at the University of Rochester.

								<b>Teaching:</b><br>
								I have been a teaching assistant for seven classes <br>
								At the University of Illinois:
								<br>
								ASTR 310: Computing in Astronomy, Spring 2022
								<br>
								ASTR 350: The Big Bang, Black Holes, and the End of the Universe, Fall 2021

								
								<br>
